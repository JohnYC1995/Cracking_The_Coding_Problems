# Cracking the coding Problems

My approach to a set of coding problems in the book Cracking the Coding Interview and LeetCode. Might not the optimal solutions. 

## Cracking the Coding Interview

### Contents

```
## Arrays and Strings

## Linked Lists

## Stacks and Queues

## Trees and Graphs

## Bit Manipulation

## Math and Logic Puzzles

## Object-Oriented Design

## Recursion and Dynamic Programming

## System Design and Scalability

## Sorting and Searching

```
### How to use

Most solutions are in the `CCIsolution/functions.py` file. You can search the question you want to see by its No. in the book. There are some special questions, which need additional classes to wrote. So you may need to go though other files in location `CCIsolution/` if you want those question's solution.

To test those solutions, I wrote a test class here:`CCIsolution/test_functions.py`. You can easily run the whole test cases by running `CCIsolution/CCI_main.py`.
